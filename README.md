# Organization-Description

We'll build up to the mean stack, meant for beginners with a mac, linux box, or developer-mode chrome-book.

## Sequence of courses follows:

1) Beginning WebDev -- Start a Project Blog
2) Dynamic Web-Pages with Node.js Express and Swig
3) +Database with MongoDB
4) SPA acceleration with Angular.js 
5) MEAN.js and Full-Stack Web-Dev Consideration

---

### 1) Beginning Web Dev -- create a project portfolio, and gain familiarity with the core web skills:

* HTML and CSS
* image-editing using GIMP xor Photoshop
* CLI
* directory structure
* saving versions with git
* using Github for full static hosting
* using Twitter's Bootstrap framework
* adding forums with Discus plugin

Highly recommended to do this concurrently with another course

### 2) Dynamic Web-Pages: Node-Express-Swig

Github-pages is great (and free!) for static content, but if you would like to do a Facebook, or like personalized app with a sign-in,
you will need to do some dynamic content.

In this class, we'll fire up your own server with Digital Ocean, so you can store and present custom websites to your guests.

* javascript
* node
* express framework
* routing
* concept of ports 
* swig for making templates and making things dynamic
* usernames and passwords, hashing, salting, and using bcrypt2 for security

It would help to know a little javascript.

### 3) + Mongo

You'll learn here how to include Mongo databases in your app and how to use it as a very scalable and agile database.

* contrast with SQL

### 4) Angular.js and SPA
Angular allows you to make a single page application, which allows webapps to feel as fast as native apps when utilized
correctly.

We'll integrate this with the other elements.

### 5) MEAN.js Stack

At this point you can already create most of your website's front-end and back-end yourself, and we'll look at other
methods of integration in particular the MEAN.js stack, for higher-order considerations as you master the topic and progress
to being `full-stack` web-developer.
